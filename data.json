				"details": "When the original Les Paul evolved into the Les Paul/SG Standard in 1961, the evolution embodied Les Paul’s vision for a sleek, powerful, contemporary solidbody electric guitar. The single-cut Standard returned to the fold later in the decade, but the distinctive double-cutaway guitar—now simply known as the SG—stayed in the lineup too, and became a major rock and blues icon. The new SG Standard embodies all the tone, feel, and look of the original rendition of this legendary guitar, with features such as a slim ’60s profile neck with a smaller early ’60s headstock, the original early ’60s pickguard, dual ’57 Classic™ humbucking pickups, and Gibson’s innovative hardware, all wrapped into a design that remains one of the most versatile guitars available today. To top it off, the SG Standard displays classic looks in your choice of Heritage Cherry, Ebony, Classic White, or Natural Burst finish, all in high-gloss nitrocellulose lacquer. And, for a nominal upcharge, you can kick the new SG Standard right into the 21st century with a factory upgrade to automated Min-ETune™ “robot” tuners. A left-handed version also available. ",

Today, the same far-out, futuristic Gibson Explorer—reintroduced in the mid-1970s—is one of the most coveted powerhouses of screaming rock and roll.",

As with its 4-string sibling, the 5-string B-5E has extremely beveled edges which allow you to really enjoy the distinct shades of light and dark where the mahogany body and ebony top meet. Adding to this differentiation of color is the even lighter 5-piece neck-thru-body maple/mahogany neck and ebony fingerboard. But fantastic looks aren't all you're getting. Ensuring you get the most of the tones these blends of woods provide are ESP SB-5 pickups (bridge and neck) with an ESP ABQ-3 3-band active EQ. A 34 in scale neck features an extra-thin, U-neck contour, making it easier for the average person to play. Other features include a 42mm standard nut, 24 XJ frets, ESP tuners, an ESP BB-604 bridge with string-thru body, and black nickel hardware.",
